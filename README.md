Breast Cancer Classification - Model Comparison
Results Summary
After evaluating five classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, k-NN) on the breast cancer dataset, the key findings are:
•	Best Model: Logistic Regression
o	Highest Accuracy (98.2456%) and F1 Score (98.00%)
o	Excellent balance of Precision (99.06%) and Recall (98.14%)
o	Most reliable for clinical diagnosis due to consistent performance.
•	Worst Model: Decision Tree
o	Lowest Accuracy (93.57%) and F1 Score (94. %)
o	Prone to overfitting, leading to poorer generalization.
Recommendation
For breast cancer detection, Logistic Regression is recommended due to its high recall (minimizing missed cases) and overall robustness. Decision Trees performed the worst and should be avoided unless optimized further.
